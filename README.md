# Connect 4 Documentation

## Dev Environment
### Install the IDE
Our preferred IDE is STM32Cube. This is because one can easily configure output and input pins of the NUCLEO board. Click [here](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) to install.
Create a workspace directory somewhere on your computer. This is where the IDE will search for your projects.
Inside that directory, create a folder for the Connect 4 project.

### GitHub Repository
Initialize a Git repository in your Connect 4 project folder using an app like Git Bash or GitHub Desktop, add the GitHub Repository as a remote origin, and pull the contents of the GitHub repository into that project folder.
